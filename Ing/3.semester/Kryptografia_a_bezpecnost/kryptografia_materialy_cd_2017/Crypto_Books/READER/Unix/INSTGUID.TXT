INSTALLING ADOBE ACROBAT READER 3.0
====================================

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat(R) Reader software--Version 3.0
This guide tells you how to install Acrobat Reader on your Sun(R), HP,  
Silicon Graphics(R), or IBM RISC System/6000(R) workstation.

Acrobat Reader is part of the Adobe Acrobat family of software, which lets 
you view, distribute, and print documents in Portable Document Format 
(PDF)--regardless of the computer, operating system, fonts, or application 
used to create the original file.  PDF files retain all the formatting, 
fonts, and graphics of the original document, and virtually any 
PostScript(TM) document can be converted into a PDF file.  PDF files can be 
created using the Acrobat Distiller(TM) program; on Macintosh(R) and 
Windows(R) systems, they can also be created using the Acrobat PDF Writer 
printer driver.  On all platforms, you can use Acrobat Exchange to 
enhance PDF files with links and bookmarks and to make PDF files display
quicker over the World Wide Web.  

To install Acrobat Reader on your workstation, you must be familiar with 
basic UNIX commands. If you are not, please consult with your system 
administrator before beginning this installation.

Upgrading from Acrobat 2.1
--------------------------

The Acrobat Reader installation script installs the Reader files into a new 
directory.  If you have an earlier version of the Reader software, it is 
not removed automatically.  For more information on removing the files, see 
"Removing Acrobat Reader Software."

If you installed Acrobat 2.1 on your Silicon Graphics workstation, you can
remove the Acrobat 2.1 software using the IRIX Software Manager.

PREPARING FOR INSTALLATION
==========================

Before beginning the installation, decide where to install the Acrobat 
Reader files.  The following sections describe the installation options.  
Review these sections carefully before installing the software.


Local versus network installation
---------------------------------

Determine whether a local (stand-alone workstation) or network 
installation is more appropriate for your situation.  

For local installation: A local installation guarantees access to the 
software from a workstation and may significantly improve performance, 
depending on how much activity there is on the network. To install Reader 
on your workstation, you must have write permission to the directory where
the Reader software is to be installed.

For network installation: A network installation makes administrative and 
maintenance tasks easier, particularly when many users want to access the 
software concurrently. (The number of concurrent users on different 
workstations is determined by how many licenses have been purchased and 
installed.) It is easier to upgrade a single copy of software installed on 
a server than to upgrade multiple copies installed on stand-alone 
workstations.

Note: Network installation should be performed by a system or network 
administrator.

If you perform a network installation, you will need to find appropriate 
network locations for the installation directory. The software should be 
installed on a network server machine with high reliability. In addition, 
the installation files should be placed in a location that is remotely 
mounted at the same location on all machines.


Choosing an installation directory
----------------------------------

Locate a directory and verify that you have sufficient disk space (see
"System Requirements and Limitations" for disk space requirements).
The default location for installation of the Acrobat Reader software is 
the following directory:

* For SunOS and HP:  /usr/Acrobat3

* For Solaris 2:  /opt/Acrobat3

* For IRIX:  /opt/Acrobat3

* For AIX:  /usr/lpp/Acrobat3

If there is insufficient space in this partition, choose another directory 
within a different partition.  Use the df command to determine the 
available space within a file system partition containing a particular 
directory.  Type df (or df -k) followed by the name of the directory in 
which you want to install the software.  For example, on SunOS type the 
following command:

    # df /usr

    Filesystem  kbytes    used     avail   capacity  Mounted on
    /dev/sd0g   207295   98377     88189        53%        /usr

There are 207,295 kilobytes (about 207 megabytes) in this partition and 
about 88 megabytes available, which is enough disk space to install the 
Acrobat Reader software. See your system documentation for more 
information on the df command.


INSTALLING THE ACROBAT READER SOFTWARE
======================================

Acrobat Reader software is distributed on CD-ROM or from the Adobe Web 
site.  This section contains instructions for installing the software after 
you have downloaded the Acrobat Reader files or mounted a CD-ROM containing
the Acrobat Reader files.

If you have downloaded the Acrobat Reader files from the Adobe Web site, 
you must first uncompress and untar the files before beginning the 
installation.  Instructions for downloading and uncompressing the files 
are available on the Adobe Web site.


The installation script prompts you to answer questions regarding the 
installation, such as where you want to place the Reader files.  
Reasonable default values are provided.  Press Return to select the 
recommended defaults, or enter your own values.

To run the installation script:

1. Change to the directory containing the installation script.  If you are 
   installing Acrobat Reader from a CD-ROM, change to the appropriate 
   directory on the CD-ROM.

2.  Start the installation script.  The filename of the script may be 
    uppercase or lowercase depending on your system for example:

     # ./install

3.  Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

If you make a mistake, you can do either of the following: 

*  Exit at different points in the procedure.

*  Press the interrupt key sequence (Control+C on most UNIX systems) to 
   cancel the installation.

When the installation is complete, a message appears indicating that you 
have installed the software successfully. Acrobat Reader is now installed. 


Acrobat Reader-installed files
------------------------------

The installation script installs the following files and directories in
the installation directory:

* The bin directory contains the acroread launch script.

* The Reader directory contains the help and ReadMe files and platform 
  specific files.

* The Fonts directory contains bundled fonts.

* The Browsers directory contains the Netscape plug-in, if supported, and 
  an example script for starting Acrobat within Netscape.


Integrating icons into the OpenWindows desktop
----------------------------------------------

Acrobat Reader provides a script that integrates Acrobat Reader icons into 
your OpenWindows desktop.  You can run this script as root or from your 
login account.  If you are logged in as root, the icons are installed for 
all users.  If you run the script as a normal user, the icons are installed 
for your use only.

To integrate icons into the desktop:

1  In a UNIX shell window, as root, locate the acroread.deskinstall script:

   # cd <installdir>/Reader/desktop/olwm

2  Run the script:

   # ./acroread.deskinstall

3  Exit from OpenWindows, and log back on for the changes to take effect. 


Creating links to the launch script
-----------------------------------

You should always start Acrobat Reader using its launch script. To make it 
easier to use the script, you can create links to the launch script 
directory. The following example creates a link in the /usr/bin 
directory:

    # ln -s /opt/Acrobat3/bin/acroread /usr/bin/acroread


STARTING ACROBAT READER
===========================

Now that you have completed the installation procedure, you are ready to 
start the Acrobat Reader application.  Always start the Reader application 
by using its launch script.

If you created symbolic links, and the alternative launch script directory 
is in the search path set by the PATH environment variable, you can start 
Acrobat Reader by typing the following:

    % acroread

If you did not create symbolic links to the launch scripts, type the 
following command to start Acrobat Reader:

    % <installdir>/bin/acroread

To launch Acrobat Reader so that it appears as an icon on your desktop, 
type the following command:

    % acroread -iconic

To view one or more files, give the filenames as command-line parameters.  
For example, to view /share/docs/annual_report.pdf and 
/user/bob/Schedule.pdf, type:

    % acroread /share/docs/annual_report.pdf /user/bob/Schedule.pdf

By default, only one Reader process can be running.  If you type acroread 
<filename> when Reader is already running, the currently running version of 
Reader becomes active and displays the specified file.

If you prefer that a new version of Reader be launched each time you start 
Reader, type the following command:

    % acroread +useFrontEndProgram
    
For more information on Acrobat Reader command-line options, type 
one of the following commands:

    % acroread -help
    % acroread -helpall
    


Converting PDF to PostScript
----------------------------

You can convert PDF files to level 1 or level 2 PostScript files from the 
command line if you are running the X Window System.  Command-line printing 
supports only the standard page size of 8.5 by 11 inches; it does not 
support shrink-to-fit or scaling commands.  If your document contains 
custom page sizes (such as 11 by 14 inches), open the file in Acrobat 
Reader and then print it or use Acrobat Exchange which has enhanced
command-line printing capabilities.

To convert a PDF file by piping it into Reader and then sending the output 
to a file, type the following:

    % cat sample.pdf | acroread -toPostScript > sample.ps 

To convert one or more PDF files, such as sample1.pdf and sample2.pdf, 
into PostScript files and place these PostScript files into the directory 
<dir>, type the following:

 % acroread -toPostScript sample1.pdf sample2.pdf <dir>

To convert a series of files expressed as both a PDF filename and a 
corresponding PostScript filename (or pairs), type the following:

    % acroread -toPostScript -pairs pdf_file_1 ps_file_1 ...

To convert a PDF file to a level 2 PostScript file, type the following:

    % acroread -toPostScript -level2 pdf_file_1


Setting up Acrobat as an inline viewer for Netscape
--------------------------------------------------

Acrobat 3 contains an example script that starts Netscape and allows you 
to view PDF files inline instead of using an Acrobat viewer as a helper 
application. The example script is located in <installdir>/Browsers.

Note: Since Netscape does not support plug-ins on an AIX workstation, you 
cannot use the Acrobat plug-in or the Netscape script to view PDF file inline 
on an AIX system.

To run the Netscape script, change directory to <installdir>/Browsers 
and type 

    % ./netscape


REMOVING ACROBAT READER SOFTWARE
================================

You can remove the Acrobat Reader software by manually deleting the files 
and directories that were created during the installation procedure. 

To remove Acrobat Reader:

1.  Enter the following commands to remove Reader from the installation 
    directory:

    % cd <installdir>
    % rm -rf Reader
    % rm bin/acroread

2.  To remove the symbolic link to the launch script, delete the file 
    /usr/bin/acroread:

    % cd /usr/bin
    % rm acroread


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

This section describes Acrobat Reader error messages and provides general 
troubleshooting information.
 

Command to launch Acrobat Reader not found
------------------------------------------

Error message: acroread -command not found

Cause: Either the Acrobat Reader launch script is not on your search path 
or the launch script you are trying to execute is actually a symbolic link 
to a file that does not exist.

Solution: First, make sure your search path has been updated by typing the 
following command:

    % rehash
    
If the launch script still does not work, locate the file that executes 
Acrobat Reader:

    % ls -l acroread

If the results indicate that acroread is actually a symbolic link to 
another file (<file>), type the following:

    % ls -l <file> 


Permission denied to launch Acrobat Reader
------------------------------------------

Error message: acroread: Permission denied

Cause: One or more files have their permissions set incorrectly. 

Solution: Examine the permissions on the Reader launch script to make sure 
you have proper execute privileges for <installdir>/bin/acroread.


Netscape launches my Acrobat viewer as a helper application instead of 
viewing PDF files inline
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Error: I set up Netscape to view PDF files inline, but my Acrobat viewer 
still appears as a helper application.

Solution: Perform the following tasks:

1. Start your Netscape application.

2. Choose General Preferences from the Options menu.

3. In the General Preferences window that appears, click the Helpers tab.

4. If necessary, scroll through the list and select application/pdf.

5. Click Delete.

6. Click OK.

7. Click Save Options in the Options menu.

8. Restart your Netscape application.
